        for young football players.

      <p>
        Zporters strategy is to help young Football players build their CV and
        Showreel online. Making it super simple to collect, share and benchmark
        all their relevant Football data. While getting the best advice and
        support from smart programs and professionals, to have more fun in a
        healthier way playing football. To help many more young football players
        reach their full potential and get their best possible football career.
        No matter where they live or what club they are part of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Football or Soccer as they say in the US, is by far the world’s largest
        sport. But it’s way behind other market segments when it comes to
        digitalization and using new technology to improve their businesses.
        There are some initiatives on the media, betting and premium clubs side
        on analytics and Video. How to collect, track, analyze and present data
        for the Professional Elite. But that data is being owned and controlled
        by media companies and the Football Clubs. And way too much is still
        done manually.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        But who is helping the players to collect and control their own data?
        Some stand alone Agents and partly Instat, WyScout does it pretty good
        for the Professional players. But no one is doing it in an organized way
        for the young talents aged 13 to 18 (21). That is where Zporter will
        approach the market. Attracting the young talents 13 - 18Y to collect,
        present and share their Football skills. Just as they do today on an
        adhoc basis on social media as Instagram, Youtube etc with their
        smartphones. Zporter will move, structure and will reward for that
        existing behavior to be done @Zporter first and then spread via other
        social media from Zporter instead. Just as all players will get their
        own Football Biography on the web, to make it super easy to find them
        just using a search engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our intention is not to compete with Club and Coach admin and planning
        services, but to partner with them instead. Just as we intend to partner
        with Videostreaming and other analytic services. To share our players
        basic data with them, just as they share their player unique data with
        us. In a way that is best for the players and with full control of what
        is shared and when, by the player themself of course. We believe that
        our players should own and control their data anytime and anywhere.
      </p>

        Will attract a lot of active young players in a very cost efficient way.
        Not only those that are playing actively. But their friends, fans and
        family as well. All Football talents ( and their family & friends )

        and most serious Scouts, Agents, Coaches and Managers and of course
        Media services in the Football Industry as well. Zporter will start in
        Sweden and Scandinavia in 2022 and from there scale our business, to

        Zporter will make money in a Freemium business model with monthly
        subscriptions for players, scouts, agents and coaches as well as
        managers and journalists. That wants to use Zporters premium services to
        get help or to buy or sell or just administer their business in a
        smarter way. But as a basic service, Zporter will always be free for our
        young players.
